    "\n",
    "The Python WordNet interface also gives us convenient tools for finding common hypernyms and paths between different synsets. In the first language technology home assignment on this course, one of your tasks was to construct a path to the lowest common hypernym for a pair of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can retrieve the lowest common hypernym(s) between two synsets with the method `lowest_common_hypernyms()`. The method returns a list of synsets. Below you can see an illustration of how to use it. Notice that in the first two lines we assign to the variables `pear_tree` and `apple_tree` specific synsets, not all of the synsets of the words. This can be done by supplying the function `wn.synset` with the name of the desired synset as a string argument. (Notice the difference between `wn.synsets(word)`, which returns all the synsets for a given word, and `wn.synset(synset_name)`, which requires a synset name and returns one synset object.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Synsets also have a method `synset1.shortest_path_distance(synset2)`, which returns the *length* of the shortest path from `synset1` to `synset2`. Note that this method does not return the path itself.\n",

    "\n",
    "**First**, you need to find the lowest common hypernym between the *pear tree* -sense (already given) and the *domestic cat* -sense of the word \"cat\". You need to find the correct synset for the *domestic cat* -sense. You can do this for example by iterating through all the synsets of the word \"cat\" and printing out the names and definitions of the synsets. When you have the name of the correct synset, you can access it with `wn.synset()`. Print out the name and the definition of the lowest common hypernym. You do not need to include in your solution the code for finding the correct sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Second**, you need to find and output the lengths of the shortest paths between the synset pairs *apple tree*-*pear tree* and *pear tree*-*domestic cat* (the synset of the word \"cat\" you found in the first part of this exercise)."
